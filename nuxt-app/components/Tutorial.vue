            <li><span class="highlight">1. Sign Up and Get Coins:</span> Create an account and top up your in-game currency. Coins are your bidding power!</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">2. Choose a Game:</span> Browse the games. Each game has 100 spots available and a countdown timer until the game closes.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">3. Place Your Bid:</span> Each coin you bid secures one spot in the game. For example, bidding 10 coins gives you 10% of the total spots and a 10% chance to win, provided 100 players join.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">4. Watch the Countdown:</span> Track how many players have joined, and adjust your bid to increase your chances.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">5. Winning the Game:</span> Once the game ends, a winner is selected randomly based on the bids. Even a 1-coin bid has a chance to win!</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">6. Claim Your Prize:</span> If you win, your prize will be awarded automatically. You can then start bidding on more games.</li>
